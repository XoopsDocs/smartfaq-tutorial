### Display Types (Full View or Summary View.)

Administrators have an option in Preferences called Q&As display type. This setting will either show all Q&As to display as Full View where questions including answers are shown, or simply in Summary View. Here, only the question title is displayed in a list. The Question title becomes a clickable link that opens the full question and answer in another page. The summary option is useful if many questions need to be listed in a single page.

 >**Note:** this is an administration setting and cannot be changed by users.
